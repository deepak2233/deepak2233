## <b>Hi there</b> 👋,
I am a Lead Data Scientist at Bajaj Finserv, owning the design and delivery of large-scale, production-grade machine learning systems across search, NLP, and intelligent automation. I lead initiatives focused on search relevance optimization, query understanding, and information retrieval, building end-to-end solutions using Elasticsearch and modern ML architectures.
In my current role, I drive the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into enterprise platforms such as FAQ and customer-support systems, improving answer quality, reducing resolution time, and enabling scalable self-service experiences. I am responsible not only for model development, but also for system design, deployment, monitoring, and long-term maintainability.
I also bring strong expertise in computer vision, particularly in object detection, robustness evaluation, and handling data and model drift in real-world production environments. I regularly translate business requirements into technical roadmaps, mentor engineers and data scientists, and ensure that research ideas are converted into reliable, high-impact production systems.

## 🚀 <b>Professional Journey:</b>
- <b>**Bajaj Finserv (Senior Data Scientist)**</b>:  
  At Bajaj Finserv, I'm working on a project to optimize the search functionality of Bajaj Mall's e-commerce platform using Elasticsearch, significantly improving search speed and relevance. Additionally, I worked on solutions to enhance the Bajaj Pay App by leveraging techniques such as regex for account aggregation and building an expense manager.

- <b>**SONY India Software Center (Machine Learning Engineer)**</b>:  
  At SONY, I developed an end-to-end pose detection pipeline in C++ from Python, utilizing the Pytorch framework for bitwise serialization and ONNX for inference. This project significantly advanced the company's computer vision capabilities.
  
- <b>**Stealth Start-up (Data Scientist)**</b>:  
  I researched model drift and anomaly detection for vision data using generative techniques like GAN and VAE. My work included evaluating model performance using statistical methods, developing data visualization pipelines, and performing A/B testing to assess solution effectiveness.
