## Hi there 👋,
As a Senior Data Scientist at Bajaj Finserv, I use deep learning to solve various natural language processing (NLP) problems. My work includes improving search results, understanding queries better, and building systems that answer questions. I am currently working on integrating large language models (LLMs) to generate better responses for FAQ chatbots, helping to resolve customer queries more effectively. I also have experience in computer vision, where I work on detecting objects and handling data drift. This involves testing and improving models to perform well with different data. I use Python, machine learning algorithms, and data science techniques to create and deploy scalable and reliable solutions. My goal is to enhance customer experience and add value to the business through innovative and practical applications of data science.

I hold a Postgraduate Degree in Machine Learning and AI from the International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore, and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science Engineering from Chandigarh University. I have also earned multiple certifications and honours in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and linear algebra from prestigious institutions and organizations. I am passionate about learning new technologies and exploring innovative applications of deep learning in various domains.

## 🧑‍💻 Professional Journey:
- <b>**Bajaj Finserv (Senior Data Scientist)**</b>: 
  At Bajaj Finserv, I'm working on a project to optimize the search functionality of Bajaj Mall's e-commerce platform using Elasticsearch, significantly improving search speed and relevance. Additionally, I worked on solutions to enhance the Bajaj Pay App by leveraging techniques such as regex for account aggregation and building an expense manager.

- <b>**SONY India Software Center (Machine Learning Engineer)**</b>:
  At SONY, I developed an end-to-end pose detection pipeline in C++ from Python, utilizing the Pytorch framework for bitwise serialization and ONNX for inference. This project significantly advanced the company's computer vision capabilities.
  
- <b>**Stealth Start-up (Data Scientist)**</b>:
  I researched model drift and anomaly detection for vision data using generative techniques like GAN and VAE. My work included evaluating model performance using statistical methods, developing data visualization pipelines, and performing A/B testing to assess solution effectiveness.
